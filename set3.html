    <b>Captain Rohit Sharma</b> was standing on the line to become one of the best captain of INDIA as he is the only captain to take india to a CWC Final without lossing a single match, But that one defeat in Ahmedabad has runied his childhood dream. I remember captain was saying in an interview that "Bhale he mera 1 hundred laga ya 2 hundred laga ya laga he nahi lekin hama WC jitna ha ya main goal ha"
    Captain sacrificed his everything to make INDIA a world champions but yet not done, still very hard to digest that the team that dominated the complete tournament has failed to score 300 runs in a 50 overs game.

    Trends that was trending on Social Media for Captain Rohit sharma throughout the WC Was:
        + Selfless Captain
        + undefeated Leader 
        + Best batter of CWC's etc
